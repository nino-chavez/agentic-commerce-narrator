---

## During Implementation

### Progress Tracking
- [ ] Update milestone status when starting phase
- [ ] Document blockers immediately when encountered
- [ ] Track actual time vs estimated time
- [ ] Note any scope creep or deviation

### Scope Discipline
- [ ] No "while we're here" additions
- [ ] No future features implemented early
- [ ] No refactoring outside current task scope
- [ ] Stick to minimal viable deliverable

---

## Post-Implementation Validation

**After completing deliverable:**

### Completion Verification
- [ ] All deliverable checklist items complete
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met
- [ ] No regressions in previous phases
- [ ] Performance targets met

### Roadmap Update
- [ ] Mark deliverable as complete in roadmap
- [ ] Update phase status
- [ ] Document any scope changes
- [ ] Update dependency status for next phase

### Documentation
- [ ] Commit message cites milestone/phase
- [ ] Audit log documents deliverable completion
- [ ] Any deviations from roadmap documented
- [ ] Next phase unblocked (if applicable)

---
