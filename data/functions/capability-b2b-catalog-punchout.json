Agent validates each line item: availability check, contract pricing application, quantity validation, substitution suggestions for out-of-stock items. 5. Agent displays validation report: matched items (green), suggested matches for review (yellow), unable to match requiring attention (red). 6. Agent allows customer to review, accept substitutions, and submit bulk order in 5-10 minutes vs 4-8 hours.",
