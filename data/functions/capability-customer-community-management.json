Severity Classification Agent categorizes violations: auto-remove (clear violations), human review needed (borderline cases), context required (depends on thread discussion). 4. Escalation Workflow Agent routes: clear violations to auto-moderation, edge cases to human moderator, severe violations to senior moderation team. 5. Audit Trail Agent logs all decisions for consistency review.",
