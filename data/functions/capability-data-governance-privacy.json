Machine learning analyzes project data flows, data types, and processing activities to automatically identify privacy risks and assign risk scores. AI-generated risk analysis compares project against GDPR, CCPA, and other regulatory requirements highlighting gaps. Automated mitigation recommendations suggest specific privacy controls (encryption, access controls, data minimization) based on identified risks. Integration with project management tools triggers PIA requirements at project initiation ensuring privacy-by-design. Workflow automation routes assessments to appropriate stakeholders (legal, security, DPO) for review and approval. Continuous monitoring tracks implementation of recommended mitigations with automated follow-up. Reusable assessment templates for common project types (new SaaS integration, new data processing, AI/ML initiative).",
