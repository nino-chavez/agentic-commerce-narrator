Segmentation Agent continuously builds and maintains dynamic segments using CDP data: behavioral triggers (cart abandoners, category browsers), lifecycle stage (new, active, at-risk, churned), predicted propensity (likely to convert, upsell candidates), engagement level (highly engaged, dormant). 2. List Hygiene Agent automatically suppresses: hard bounces, spam traps, chronic non-openers (180+ days), complainers and unsubscribes. 3. Segments update in real-time as customer behavior changes. 4. Agent recommends new segment opportunities based on campaign performance.",
