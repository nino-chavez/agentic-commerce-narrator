They manually build allocation spreadsheets with complex formulas that are error-prone and difficult to maintain. Cost allocations are performed monthly or quarterly with significant delays, limiting their usefulness for operational decision-making. The lack of activity-based costing leads to cross-subsidization where some products or customers appear profitable while actually consuming disproportionate resources. True profitability insights are obscured, leading to suboptimal strategic decisions.",

A Cost Pool Identifier maps costs to activity pools based on resource consumption drivers rather than simplistic proxies. An Activity Tracer measures actual activity consumption by product, customer, channel, and order using operational data (transactions processed, service calls, shipments, returns). A Cost Allocator applies activity rates to assign costs accurately, revealing true product and customer profitability. A Profitability Analyzer synthesizes allocated costs with revenues to calculate comprehensive P&Ls by any dimension, and a Decision Support Engine uses true economics to guide strategic choices (pricing, customer focus, SKU rationalization).",
