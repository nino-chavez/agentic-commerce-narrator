      "workflow": "1. Loyalty Analytics Agent calculates member lifetime value: current value, predicted future value, loyalty lift. 2. ROI Attribution Agent measures incremental revenue: matched control group analysis, loyalty vs non-loyalty spend. 3. Agent attributes revenue lift to program elements: points, tiers, gamification, personalization. 4. Agent quantifies program ROI: (incremental revenue - program costs) / program costs. 5. Real-time dashboards show program health, member value, and ROI trends.",
