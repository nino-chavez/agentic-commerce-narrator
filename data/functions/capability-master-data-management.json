Machine learning continuously updates lineage as systems change. Interactive lineage visualizations show end-to-end data journeys from source to consumption (e.g., 'Customer email flows from CRM → MDM → Marketing Platform → Email Service'). Automated impact analysis immediately identifies all downstream systems and reports affected by proposed data changes. Natural language query interface enables business users to ask 'What systems use customer email?' and receive instant answers with visual lineage diagrams. Compliance reporting demonstrates complete data provenance for regulatory audits. Root cause analysis for data quality issues traces upstream to identify originating system.",
