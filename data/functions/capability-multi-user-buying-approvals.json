Spend Analytics Agent generates real-time dashboards tracking: total spend, spend by category (IT, office supplies, marketing, etc.), top vendors, department comparisons, trend analysis. 2. Agent provides drill-down capability: click category to see vendors, click vendor to see users, click user to see individual transactions (self-service exploration). 3. Agent detects spending anomalies: 'IT spend up 40% this month vs historical average - investigate' or 'Department X purchasing from 15 different office supply vendors - consolidation opportunity'. 4. Agent identifies tail spend consolidation: 'You're spending $50K across 25 different vendors for office supplies - consolidating to 2 preferred vendors could save 20-30%'. 5. Agent monitors contract compliance: 'You have a contract with Vendor A for laptops at $800, but 30% of purchases are from other vendors at $950 - enforce contract compliance for savings'. 6. Agent recommends actionable cost savings: vendor consolidation targets, contract compliance enforcement, duplicate spend elimination.",
