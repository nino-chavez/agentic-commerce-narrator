Machine learning identifies anomalies, trends, and root causes automatically (e.g., 'DC3 pack times increased 15% yesterday due to new hires and product mix shift'). Predictive models forecast capacity constraints, cost overruns, and SLA risks 24-72 hours in advance. AI-generated recommendations for optimization opportunities (shift fulfillment mix, adjust labor, renegotiate carrier rates). Natural language query interface enables business users to ask questions ('Why did fulfillment costs spike last week?'). Continuous benchmarking against industry standards and best-in-class performers.",
