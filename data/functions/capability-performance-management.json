Forced distribution applied: 10% top performers, 70% meets expectations, 20% needs improvement (creates unhealthy competition). 5.

Agent provides data-driven calibration recommendations: 'Sarah and Bob have similar goal achievement (90% vs 88%) and 360 scores (4.3 vs 4.2) - recommend both rated 4.5 vs Sarah 4.5 and Bob 4.0'. 3. Agent reduces calibration meeting to 2-3 hours (vs 8-12 hours) by pre-flagging only cases needing discussion (20-30% of employees). 4. Agent performs pay equity analysis: 'Women in Engineering rated 4.2 avg receiving 3.0% merit vs men rated 4.2 receiving 3.5% merit - investigate pay disparity'. 5. Agent models pay-for-performance scenarios: 'Current merit budget of 3.5% applied to ratings yields 2.5% merit for meets expectations, 4.5% for exceeds - does this align with philosophy?'. 6. Agent flags compensation anomalies: 'John rated top performer but paid at market 50th percentile - retention risk, recommend adjustment'.",
