Inventory shortage results from under-forecast: stockouts on 20% of SKUs, lost sales $500K. 6.

Agent generates probabilistic forecast: 'Next week sales: $1.2M most likely (50% confidence), range $1.0M-$1.4M (80% confidence interval), Black Friday: $7.5M-$9.0M (accounting for promotional calendar and historical spike patterns)'. 5. Agent updates forecast daily: new transaction data, weather updates, promotional changes incorporated automatically (vs monthly static forecast). 6. Inventory team receives forecast: orders aligned to predicted demand, 90% inventory accuracy (vs 60% manual), stockouts reduced 70%. 7. 40-60% forecast error reduction (80-90% accuracy vs 50-60%), proactive planning (daily updates catch trends early).",
