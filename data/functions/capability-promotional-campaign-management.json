Budget Allocation Agent monitors campaign performance continuously: tracks ROI, conversion rates, customer acquisition costs by channel and campaign identifying optimization opportunities in real-time. 2. Agent identifies reallocation opportunities: detects 'Mobile channel achieving 5.0x ROI with budget 80% utilized while Email achieving 2.0x ROI with 50% utilization' recommending shift. 3. Spend Optimization Agent calculates optimal allocation: uses ML model to recommend budget distribution maximizing overall marketing ROI showing 'Shift $50K from Email to Mobile and $30K from Social to Email for +18% ROI improvement'. 4. Agent implements dynamic reallocation: automatically adjusts budgets weekly or monthly based on performance within guardrails (max 20% shift per period) vs quarterly manual changes. 5. Agent forecasts budget utilization: predicts 'Mobile budget will exhaust in 2 weeks based on current spend rate' alerting team to increase budget or pause campaigns proactively. 6. Agent tests budget scenarios: simulates alternative allocation strategies ('Increase Mobile 30% and reduce Social 20%') predicting impact on overall marketing efficiency before implementation. 7. 15-30% marketing efficiency improvement through dynamic budget reallocation, ML-powered spend optimization, and performance-based shifts vs fixed quarterly allocations.",
