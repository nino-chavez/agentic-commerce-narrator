Agent monitors progress: 'Driver #3 running 10 minutes behind schedule, recommend skip low-priority delivery #7 (standard shipping, flexible window), prioritize delivery #8 (premium customer, tight window)'. 6. Dispatcher approves, driver gets updated route, completes all priority deliveries on time. 7. End-of-day: 2% failed deliveries (vs 15%), 25-40% delivery time reduction (32 min per stop vs 45 min), 30-50% fuel cost savings ($7 per delivery vs $12).",
