Renewal Automation Agent pre-fills renewal applications: populates application forms with store data (address, EIN, prior license numbers) from database, manager reviews and submits reducing 4-8 hours to 30-60 minutes. 4. Agent tracks renewal progress: monitors application submission, agency processing status, renewal approval, new license receipt updating database in real-time. 5. Agent escalates late renewals: if manager doesn't submit application 30 days before expiration, escalates to district manager: 'Store #123 liquor license renewal pending - 25 days until expiration - immediate action required'. 6. Tracking Dashboard shows corporate visibility: real-time view of all store licenses, expiration dates, renewal status, at-risk licenses enabling proactive corporate intervention. 7. <2% late renewal rate (vs 10-20%) through automated reminders, application pre-filling, escalation, and centralized tracking eliminating $160-$400 late fees per year per store.",
