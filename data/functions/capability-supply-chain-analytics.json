They create aging reports by bucketing inventory into 30-60-90 day categories. Stockout and overstock identification relies on simple threshold rules (e.g., flag items with 0 units or >180 days supply). The analysis is periodic (weekly or monthly), provides limited root cause insights, and lacks predictive capabilities to prevent future issues.

A Stockout Predictor uses ML to forecast impending stockouts based on demand patterns and lead times, enabling proactive replenishment.

They calculate aggregate return rates and costs but lack detailed analysis of root causes or cost drivers. Reverse logistics costs are treated as overhead rather than precisely tracked by product, channel, or return reason. Restocking rates and salability assessments are subjective, leading to inconsistent inventory disposition decisions. The absence of systematic analysis prevents identification of product quality issues, policy abuse, or process improvement opportunities.",

A Return Reason Analyzer applies NLP to customer-provided return reasons, automatically categorizing and identifying patterns (quality defects, sizing issues, buyer's remorse). A Reverse Logistics Cost Tracker precisely allocates costs (shipping, inspection, restocking, disposal) to each return, enabling product and channel profitability analysis. A Restocking Optimizer assesses product condition and market demand to recommend optimal disposition (restock, markdown, liquidate, dispose). An Improvement Engine identifies systematic issues requiring action—product quality problems, misleading descriptions, policy abuse—and recommends corrective actions.",
