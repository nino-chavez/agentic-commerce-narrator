# Intent-Driven Engineering (IDE) Methodology

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Created:** 2025-10-11
**Purpose:** Codified approach for AI-human collaborative development that avoids tool concurrency issues while maximizing throughput

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Sequential Feature Execution
**Rule:** Execute one feature at a time through its complete lifecycle before starting the next.

**Rationale:** Prevents tool concurrency explosions (400 errors) by ensuring focused, controlled progression.

**Implementation:**
```
Feature A: Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Integrate ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Document
[CHECKPOINT: Human approval to continue]
Feature B: Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Integrate ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Document
[CHECKPOINT: Human approval to continue]
Feature C: ...
```

### 2. Phase-Based Task Decomposition
**Rule:** Break each feature into 6-8 distinct phases with clear deliverables.

**Standard Phases:**
1. **Research** - Understand existing codebase, dependencies, patterns
2. **Design** - Create data models, component structure, API contracts
3. **Implement** - Write core functionality
4. **Integrate** - Connect to existing systems
5. **Test** - Validate functionality (manual or automated)
6. **Document** - Update docs, add comments, create examples

**Tool Usage per Phase:**
- Research: Read (3-5 files), Grep (2-3 searches), Glob (1-2 patterns)
- Design: Write (data files), Read (reference files)
- Implement: Write (new components), Edit (modifications)
- Integrate: Edit (existing files), Read (integration points)
- Test: Bash (dev server checks), BashOutput (verify)
- Document: Write/Edit (docs)

### 3. Controlled Parallelism
**Rule:** Only parallelize within a single phase, never across phases or features.

**Safe Parallelism:**
‚úÖ Reading 3-5 files simultaneously during Research phase
‚úÖ Grepping multiple patterns during discovery
‚úÖ Installing multiple dependencies in one command

**Unsafe Parallelism:**
‚ùå Implementing Feature A while testing Feature B
‚ùå Editing 10+ files across different features
‚ùå Running multiple complex agents concurrently

### 4. Todo-Driven Progress Tracking
**Rule:** Maintain a visible todo list that reflects current phase and provides checkpoints.

**Todo Structure:**
```javascript
[
  { content: "Research X", activeForm: "Researching X", status: "completed" },
  { content: "Design Y data model", activeForm: "Designing Y", status: "completed" },
  { content: "Implement Z component", activeForm: "Implementing Z", status: "in_progress" },
  { content: "Integrate with W", activeForm: "Integrating with W", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Test functionality", activeForm: "Testing functionality", status: "pending" },
  { content: "Document changes", activeForm: "Documenting changes", status: "pending" }
]
```

**Benefits:**
- Human can see progress at a glance
- Clear indication of what's happening now
- Natural stopping points for "continue" checkpoints
- Evidence of systematic approach

### 5. Hot-Reload Verification
**Rule:** After each integration, verify hot-reload works before proceeding.

**Implementation:**
1. Make code changes
2. Check `BashOutput` for HMR update confirmation
3. Only proceed if hot-reload successful
4. If errors, fix immediately before continuing

### 6. Human Approval Gates
**Rule:** Pause for explicit "continue" signal between major features.

**Gate Locations:**
- After completing each priority item
- Before starting new major feature
- When encountering architectural decisions
- When shifting between different areas of codebase

**Format:**
```markdown
## ‚úÖ Priority X Complete: [Feature Name]

[Detailed summary of what was accomplished]

**Ready for Priority Y: [Next Feature]**

Would you like to continue?
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. ‚ùå Aggressive Parallelization
```markdown
BAD:
- Launching 5 agents simultaneously
- Editing 15 files across 3 features
- Running multiple complex build processes
```

**Why it fails:** Tool concurrency limits (400 errors)

**Fix:** Sequential execution with limited parallelism

### 2. ‚ùå Skipping Checkpoints
```markdown
BAD:
- Implementing Features A, B, C without stopping
- No todo list updates
- No human approval between features
```

**Why it fails:** User loses visibility, can't course-correct

**Fix:** Explicit checkpoints with summaries

### 3. ‚ùå Batching Todo Updates
```markdown
BAD:
- Mark 5 todos complete at end
- No in_progress updates
- No activeForm descriptions
```

**Why it fails:** User doesn't see progress

**Fix:** Real-time todo updates as work happens

### 4. ‚ùå Working Without Dev Server Verification
```markdown
BAD:
- Make 10 changes
- Never check BashOutput
- Assume everything works
```

**Why it fails:** Errors compound, hard to debug

**Fix:** Check hot-reload after each integration

### 5. ‚ùå Ignoring User Context Switches
```markdown
BAD:
- User opens new file (hint about interest)
- Continue with original plan anyway
```

**Why it fails:** Misses user intent signals

**Fix:** Adapt based on user actions

## Integration with Existing Agent Systems

### For ~/Workspace Projects

**Add to `.agent-os/instructions/core/methodology.md`:**

```markdown
# Intent-Driven Engineering Integration

When executing multi-feature implementations:

1. **Use IDE methodology** for sequential feature execution
2. **Preserve existing agent protocols** for specialized tasks
3. **Add checkpoints** between major features
4. **Maintain todo lists** for visibility
5. **Verify hot-reload** after integrations

## When to Use IDE vs Task Tool Agents

**Use IDE (sequential):**
- Multi-feature roadmaps (3+ features)
- Complex integrations across codebase
- When user wants to see progress step-by-step

**Use Task Tool (agents):**
- Single complex feature with many steps
- Specialized tasks (code review, testing, documentation)
- Background research or analysis
- When user wants hands-off execution

**Combine Both:**
- IDE for feature sequencing
- Task tool for complex sub-tasks within each feature
```

### Subagent Enhancement

**Add to specialized agents (e.g., `coding-standards-reviewer`):**

```markdown
## Checkpoint Protocol

After completing review:
1. Update todo list to mark review complete
2. Provide summary of findings
3. Ask: "Shall I proceed with applying fixes?" [CHECKPOINT]
4. Wait for user approval
5. Apply fixes sequentially (one file at a time)
6. Verify after each fix
```

---

## Metrics for Success

### Session-Level Metrics
- **Features Completed:** Count of priorities finished
- **Errors Encountered:** 400 errors = methodology violation
- **Checkpoint Effectiveness:** User corrections after checkpoints
- **Hot-Reload Success Rate:** % of integrations that worked first try

### Example: This Session
```
‚úÖ Features Completed: 3 (Priority 10, 9, 8)
‚úÖ 400 Errors: 0
‚úÖ Checkpoint Effectiveness: 100% (3/3 approvals)
‚úÖ Hot-Reload Success: ~95% (1 bug caught and fixed)
‚úÖ Lines of Code: ~1000+
‚úÖ Session Duration: ~60 minutes of focused work
```

## Quick Reference Card

### The IDE Approach in 5 Steps

1. **Break into Features** - One priority at a time
2. **Phase Each Feature** - Research ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Integrate ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Doc
3. **Update Todos Real-Time** - Keep user informed
4. **Verify After Integration** - Check hot-reload works
5. **Checkpoint Between Features** - Get approval to continue

### Red Flags (Stop and Reassess)

üö© More than 5 parallel tool calls
üö© Working on 2+ features simultaneously
üö© Todo list not updated for 3+ actions
üö© Haven't checked BashOutput in 5+ changes
üö© User said "continue" but no checkpoint was provided

## Adoption Guide

### For New Projects

1. Add `INTENT_DRIVEN_ENGINEERING.md` to project root
2. Create `.agent-os/instructions/core/ide-methodology.md`
3. Update agent instructions to reference IDE
4. Use template workflows for features

### For Existing Projects

1. Introduce during next major feature work
2. Apply retrospectively to understand past issues
3. Train team/agents on methodology
4. Measure before/after metrics

### For AI Assistants

2. Apply templates to user requests
3. Create todo lists proactively
4. Pause for checkpoints
5. Report metrics at session end
