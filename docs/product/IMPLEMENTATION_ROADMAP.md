# Implementation Roadmap

## Commerce Transformation Navigator

**Version:** 1.0.0
**Date:** 2025-10-21
**Status:** Planning
**Related Documents:** [PRD.md](./PRD.md), [PRODUCT_MISSION.md](./PRODUCT_MISSION.md)

---

## Overview

This roadmap defines a three-milestone implementation strategy for the Commerce Transformation Navigator. Each milestone builds on the previous one, progressively delivering value while maintaining architectural integrity and the four foundational principles.

**Development Approach:** Agent OS Workflow
- **Milestone 1 & 2:** Mix of Careful Mode (architecture) and Fast Mode (features)
- **Milestone 3:** Primarily Fast Mode with selective Careful Mode reviews
- **Risk Management:** Architecture reviews for data model changes, performance reviews for optimization

---

## Milestone 1: The Core Narrative (MVP)

**Theme:** Prove the core narrative flow and progressive loading architecture.

**Timeline:** 3-4 weeks
**Status:** Not Started
**Risk Level:** High (foundational architecture)
**Workflow Mode:** Careful Mode

### Goals

Deliver a functional proof-of-concept that demonstrates:
1. Progressive loading architecture (domains.json → domain-specific JSON)
2. Basic navigation hierarchy (Domain → Capability)
3. A-vs-B comparison view (Traditional vs. Agentic)
4. URL state management (shareable links)

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] User can load app and see 10 domains in <1 second
- [ ] User can expand domain and see capabilities in <500ms
- [ ] User can click capability and see comparison view
- [ ] URL captures navigation state (domain, capability)
- [ ] All data fetched progressively (no monolithic file)

---

### Phase 1.1: Data Architecture Foundation (Careful Mode)

**Duration:** 1 week
**Owner:** Technical Lead + Data Engineer

#### Deliverables

**1. Progressive Loading Data Structure**

Create domain-specific JSON files from existing compiled graph data:

- [ ] `domains.json` - 10 domain entries with metadata
- [ ] `customer-experience.json` - All capabilities for Customer Experience domain
- [ ] `sales-commerce.json` - All capabilities for Sales & Commerce domain
- [ ] `merchandising-product.json` - Merchandising & Product domain data
- [ ] `supply-chain.json` - Supply Chain & Logistics domain data
- [ ] `payments-finance.json` - Payments & Financial Operations domain data
- [ ] `data-analytics.json` - Data & Analytics domain data
- [ ] `technology-platform.json` - Technology & Platform domain data
- [ ] `human-capital.json` - Human Capital domain data
- [ ] `enterprise-support.json` - Enterprise Support domain data
- [ ] `governance-risk.json` - Governance, Risk & Compliance domain data

**Data Schema Validation:**

- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for new JSON structure
- [ ] Runtime type validation implemented
- [ ] Schema migration script (compiled-graph-data.ts → domain JSONs)
- [ ] Data integrity checks (all capability IDs referenced exist)
- [ ] Edge validation (functions/agents/personas reference valid capabilities)

**Technical Notes:**
- Use existing `data/types/graph.ts` as base
- Extend with new `DomainDataFile` and `DomainsIndex` types
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing type guards

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All domain JSON files generated programmatically
- [ ] Total payload size: domains.json < 5KB, each domain file < 100KB
- [ ] Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Zero ESLint warnings
- [ ] Passes data integrity validation script

---

**2. Progressive Data Loader Service**

Update `graphDataLoader.ts` to support progressive loading:

- [ ] `loadDomainsIndex()` - Fetch domains.json
- [ ] `loadDomainData(domainId)` - Fetch specific domain JSON
- [ ] `getCachedDomainData(domainId)` - Retrieve from in-memory cache
- [ ] `preloadAdjacentDomains(domainId)` - Prefetch adjacent domains
- [ ] Error handling with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Domains index loads in <300ms (dev environment)
- [ ] Domain data loads in <500ms (dev environment)
- [ ] Failed fetches automatically retry
- [ ] Cache prevents duplicate fetches for same domain
- [ ] Error states surfaced to UI components

---

### Phase 1.2: URL State Management (Careful Mode)

**Duration:** 3-4 days
**Owner:** Frontend Lead

#### Deliverables

**1. URL State Service**

Create `urlStateService.ts` for managing application state in URL:

- [ ] `parseUrlState()` - Parse query parameters into state object
- [ ] `serializeStateToUrl(state)` - Convert state to query string
- [ ] `updateUrl(partialState)` - Update URL without page reload
- [ ] `getInitialState()` - Extract state from URL on load
- [ ] `validateUrlState(state)` - Validate and sanitize URL parameters

**State Schema:**

```typescript
interface UrlState {
  domain?: string;           // Expanded domain ID
  capability?: string;       // Selected capability ID
  industry?: string;         // Industry filter
  persona?: string;          // Persona filter
  cart?: string[];          // Array of capability IDs
  mode?: 'present';         // Presentation mode flag
  slide?: number;           // Current slide in presentation
  tab?: 'functions' | 'agents' | 'personas';  // Active context tab
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] URL updates on every navigation action
- [ ] Browser back/forward buttons work correctly
- [ ] Refreshing page restores exact view state

- Request for help

**Audience:** Product Owner, Technical Lead, Stakeholders

**Delivery:** Friday EOD

---

### Milestone Reviews

**Format:**
- Demo of completed features
- Metrics review (performance, quality)
- Lessons learned
- Retrospective
- Go/No-Go decision for next milestone

**Audience:** Full team + stakeholders

**Timing:** End of each milestone (3-4 week intervals)

---

### Risk Escalation

**When to Escalate:**
- Critical blocker (>2 days delay)
- Performance regression (>10% slower)
- Security vulnerability discovered
- Scope creep request (>5% effort increase)

**Escalation Path:**
1. Frontend Lead (day-to-day issues)
2. Technical Lead (architectural decisions)
3. Product Owner (scope/priority changes)
4. Steering Committee (timeline/budget impact)

## Appendix: Agent OS Workflow Integration

### Milestone 1: Careful Mode Approach

**Why Careful Mode:**
- Foundational architecture (progressive loading)
- Data model restructuring (breaking changes)
- URL state management (complex)

**Validations:**
- Full test suite (unit + integration)
- Performance benchmarks
- Architecture review required

**Manual Reviews:**
- Data migration validation
- Type safety verification
- Performance impact assessment

---

### Milestone 2: Fast Mode with Selective Reviews

**Why Fast Mode:**
- UI component development (low risk)
- Well-defined interfaces (TypeScript contracts)
- Incremental feature additions

**When to Trigger Careful Mode:**
- NLP search performance issues
- Filter logic complexity increases
- Cart state synchronization problems

**Validations:**
- Automated linting and type-check
- Unit tests for new components
- Basic performance checks

---

### Milestone 3: Primarily Fast Mode

**Why Fast Mode:**
- Visual polish (low technical risk)
- Incremental improvements
- Bug fixes

**When to Trigger Careful Mode:**
- Accessibility compliance review
- Performance optimization (Careful Mode)
- Production deployment validation

**Validations:**
- Accessibility audit (manual + automated)
- Cross-browser testing
- Performance regression tests

---

**Roadmap Status:** Ready for execution upon PRD approval.

**Next Actions:**
1. Secure stakeholder approval for roadmap
2. Assemble team and allocate resources
3. Set up development environment with Agent OS workflow
4. Kick off Milestone 1, Phase 1.1 (Data Architecture Foundation)
