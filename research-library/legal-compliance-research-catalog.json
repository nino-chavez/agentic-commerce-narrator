  "keyFindings": {
    "tierDistribution": "Exceptional quality: 96.43% Tier 1 sources (27/28 projections) - second highest tier percentage across all domains. Only 1 Tier 2 projection (Matter Resolution Time) where specific controlled studies unavailable.",
    "sourceTypes": "Comprehensive mix of vendor case studies (LawGeex, OneTrust, Absorb LMS, GRC vendors), analyst reports (Forrester TEI), and industry research (Harvard Business Review, regulatory intelligence), providing multi-sourced validation.",
    "causalMechanisms": "All 28 projections include detailed causal explanations with specific technology mechanisms (AI contract drafting, regulatory intelligence monitoring, e-billing automation, data discovery platforms) and contextual bounds.",
    "vendorCoverage": "Strong representation from leading legal technology vendors: LawGeex (contract AI), Absorb LMS (training), OneTrust (privacy), Cyber Sierra/Scrut (GRC), LEDES e-billing platforms, and regulatory intelligence systems.",
    "metricSpecificity": "All projections quantified with specific ranges and comparative baselines enabling defensible ROI calculations. Multiple projections include dollar savings examples ($3.7M avoided fines, $50B missed renewals, 15-25% spend reduction).",
    "implementationContext": "Projections include practical requirements (platform selection, integration needs, stakeholder adoption) and acknowledge variation factors (matter complexity, organization size, current maturity levels).",
    "crossValidation": "Multiple projections validated across capabilities - e.g., invoice review time reduction consistent across Legal Operations (70%) and Legal Spend Management (80%), policy/training completion rates similar (95-100%), continuous monitoring benefits replicated across compliance/risk/privacy."

  "researchNotes": {
    "methodology": "Systematic capability-by-capability research using web search for 2024 vendor case studies, analyst reports, and industry benchmarks. Cross-validated metrics across multiple sources where available. Applied conservative estimates accounting for implementation variation.",
    "challenges": "Legal/compliance domain has fewer published case studies with specific metrics compared to operational domains (retail, HR). Some projections rely on vendor-reported statistics vs independent research. Matter Resolution Time required Tier 2 classification due to limited published benchmarks.",
    "strengths": "Legal technology market mature with extensive vendor case study data, landmark research (Harvard Business Review, Forrester TEI), and clear ROI metrics. High-profile implementations (Fortune 500, OneTrust 99% cost reduction) provide credible validation.",
    "domainCharacteristics": "Legal/compliance transformations show dramatic improvements (70-99% in many metrics) due to low traditional baselines - manual processes dominate current state creating significant automation opportunity. Cost savings particularly compelling ($3.7M avoided fines, 15-25% spend reduction, $50B missed renewals).",
    "nextSteps": "Consider General Counsel validation workshop to review projections for real-world legal department factors. Quarterly refresh recommended as legal technology vendors publish new case studies and Forrester/Gartner release updated research."
